A UK woman who claims she married a ghost has accused her haunting husband of ruining their honeymoon.
The singer, known as Brocarde, said her husband never picked up the tab and ruined a nice moment on the beach with her during their honeymoon on Barry Island in Wales.
"Edwardo thought he was being passionate and romantic by wrestling me to the ground to frolic in the sand, but I was trying to share my ice cream with him and it went everywhere, all over my face, in my hair and then, of course, the sand stuck to it so I looked like I'd had a fight with a giant seagull," the singer told the Daily Star.
In November, the 38-year-old said she married the ghost of a Victorian soldier called Edwardo and posted a video of them sharing their vows on Instagram.
In the video, Edwardo appeared to have stage fright, so the singer told the celebrant "He does" when the ghost was meant to say, "I do".
The 38-year-old claimed she met her husband when she was struggling to sleep during a thunderstorm after an argument with her friend.
The singer also told the Daily Star the groom ruined their honeymoon by emptying the spirits in the minibar.
"Liquor bottles are always mysteriously left empty, aside from the gin bottle, they are always left standing, he's obviously not that partial to that spirit."
Brocarde, who has over 175,000 followers on Instagram, also shared a video of her and her husband apparently sealing their marriage with a kiss.
