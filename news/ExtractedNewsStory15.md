The world's most passionate The Lord of the Rings fans will be excited by their first ever chance to enjoy overnight stays at the Hobbiton film set in Waikato, soon to be on offer via Airbnb.
As a 'special campaign' by the accommodation platform intended to pay homage to the 10th anniversary of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, three two-night stays for up to four guests in March 2023 are being offered at a rate of just NZ$10 per night, plus taxes and fees.
For that, guests will get to stay in rooms curated by An Unexpected Journey art director Brian Massey, private access to a personal hobbit hole, themed food and drink and a behind-the-scenes private tour of the film set.
"With access to 44 Hobbit Holes, The Millhouse, The Green Dragon Inn and other beloved locations from the work of JRR Tolkien, guests will take an unexpected journey into Middle-earth for an experience unlike any other," said Airbnb.
How to book:
- The stays will be available to book via the Airbnb website from 10am on Wednesday, December 14 to anyone aged 18 or over with a verified Airbnb profile and a history of positive reviews.
- They take place on March 2 - 4, March 9 - 11, and March 16 - 18, 2023 and include transportation to and from Auckland Airport.
"For more than two decades, we've welcomed millions of passionate fans to Hobbiton Movie Set but never before has anyone had the opportunity to spend a night in Middle-earth," said host Russell Alexander.
"I am delighted to share the beauty of my family's farm and pleased to be hosting this iconic location on Airbnb for fans from around the world."
Airbnb's country manager for Australia and New Zealand Susan Wheeldon added: "We are delighted to partner with Hobbiton Movie Set to give fans of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit an opportunity to experience Middle-earth like never before.
"This special campaign brings the magic of these extraordinary films and the beauty of New Zealand to life for Airbnb's global community."
Airbnb and Hobbiton Movie Set have not announced if there are any plans for additional overnight stays to be offered beyond the three already announced.
