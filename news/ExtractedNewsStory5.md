Black Ferns co-captain Ruahei Demant was the big winner at the New Zealand Rugby awards, taking out three honours to recognise her achievements in 2022.
Demant, 27, was recognised as the best player in New Zealand in 2022 and named as the Kelvin R Tremain Memorial player of the year - just the third woman to do so after Black Ferns teammates Kendra Cocksedge (2018) and Sarah Hirini (2021).
The Black Ferns' co-captain also added the award for Māori player of the year and the Black Ferns' player of the year, holding off competition from teammates Hirini, Stacey Fluhler and Theresa Fitzpatrick.
As winners of the Rugby World Cup, the awards were a celebration of the Black Ferns overall, after capturing the nation's hearts this year.
The Black Ferns took home the New Zealand team of the year award, while director of rugby Wayne Smith was named as the New Zealand coach of the year.
National awards for Demant and Smith come after the pair were both recognised by World Rugby, winning the women's 15s player of the year and world coach of the year respectively.
Fluhler was also awarded the try of the year for 2022, won for her crucial score in the Black Ferns' Rugby World Cup final against England.
Black Ferns front rower Luka Connor was also named as the inaugural winner of Super Rugby Aupiki's player of the year, after a breakthrough season for Chiefs Manawa earned her national selection.
Ardie Savea was named as the All Blacks' player of the year after a dominant 12 months in the black jersey, even if the 29-year-old was snubbed in World Rugby's player of the year awards.
Away from the international game, Wellington was awarded New Zealand men's national team of the year, after a season that saw the Lions win both the NPC and Ranfurly Shield.
Canterbury's all-conquering Farah Palmer Cup side was recognised with the women's national team of the year, as Blair Baxter was also named as the women's national coach of the year.
Crusaders boss Scott Robertson's achievements - winning a sixth Super Rugby title in six years - had him win New Zealand national men's coach of the year, while fullback Will Jordan was named as Super Rugby player of the year.
