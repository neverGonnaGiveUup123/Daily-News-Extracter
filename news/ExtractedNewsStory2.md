The Immigration Minister is considering visa rule changes after six child circus acrobats were uplifted and returned to China amid allegations of exploitation.
Minister Michael Wood called for an investigation after Newshub revealed on Wednesday allegations of poor treatment of the children, who had come to New Zealand on entertainment work visas.
Zirka Circus's 2019 intake of Chinese acrobats comprised 16 children, some as young as 11 years old. And they weren't here for a one-off weekend show - they toured New Zealand for years.
That was until six children were uplifted amid allegations of "squalid" living conditions, "neglect" and issues with pay.
"Any reasonable person who looks at the broad facts of this case will feel a degree of discomfort and concern," Wood told Newshub.
The children came to Aotearoa on entertainment work visas. It's a visa with no rules regarding child safety, well-being or education.
"That's what I'll be getting further advice on, that will be coming through to me in the coming weeks."
"I think most of us would look at that and think that if children are coming in for that length of time, we would want good assurance about their pastoral care," he said.

Immigration New Zealand confirmed the entertainment work visa has no conditions relating to the pastoral care of children. It does not require a parent to accompany them, nor does it require the education of children.
Oranga Tamariki's Paula Attrill oversaw the agency's investigation.
"There was next to no evidence of kids' drawings or anything, and so we were confident that the level of education just did not meet the mark in terms of what the kids had a right to receive."
Former Zirka owners, sisters Jeni and Judy Hou, deny allegations of exploitation. They say they did arrange correspondence school for young performers, but admit few participated.
"We provided that but they don't attend the class. It's like any country, New Zealand as well. You have the class but students are probably absent," said Jeni Hou.
Wood said if an investigation finds a gap, "that would be a concern".
"It would be something that I would want to change."
Migrant Workers Association president Anu Kaloti welcomes Wood seeking advice but wants action now until the visa issues are resolved.
"What needs to happen immediately is to suspend that visa category for people below the age of 18 years."
Kaloti believes the Zirka example is deeply worrying.
"It's akin to modern-day slavery and child labour."
Wood wouldn't say if the visa type has enabled exploitation and said he will wait to see the full results of the investigation.
The investigation into the visa settings is due soon.
Immigration New Zealand says it has made some initial operation changes in the meantime.
General Manager of Verification and Compliance Karen Bishop told Newshub it takes the welfare of children on work visas seriously.
"As a result of this case, some internal processes were updated to notify immigration officers of additional well-being risks for children entering New Zealand on work visas and provide some guidance on how to manage this risk," she said.
