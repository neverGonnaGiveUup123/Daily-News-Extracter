A senior volunteer firefighter describes the culture at Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) as an "old boys' club" after FENZ failed to improve its culture following a report in 2019.
An independent review by the Deputy Public Service Commissioner has revealed that:
- Key problems identified three years ago have not been addressed.
- The complaints process is deepening the trauma of those being bullied and harassed.
- That a complete overhaul of the organisation's attitudes and behaviour is urgently needed.
The review of FENZ's implementation of the 2019 report made 20 recommendations and FENZ is vowing to act on all of them.
After 22 years in the fire service, senior volunteer firefighter Judith Stanley said "some women are not safe in their brigades".
"That's what I know and some women have had to leave their brigades because they feel unsafe."
As the first female voted onto the United Fire Brigade Association board, she said she's had her own bullying experiences.
"I was silenced, my concerns were ignored. Intimidation is the norm."
A 2019 report raised similar concerns, revealing a culture of bullying and harassment, with unacceptable levels of racism, sexism and homophobia.
And a review of Fire and Emergency's response to that report has found the organisation has failed to improve its culture.
"Poor behaviours remain that are both causing harm to people, and tarnishing Fire and Emergency's reputation," said Deputy Public Service Commissioner Helene Quilter.
And the review lead Belinda Clark said the complaints process is not fit for purpose.
"It is, in fact, deepening the trauma that's experienced by victims of bullying and harassment."
Fire and Emergency Board chair Rebecca Keoghan acknowledged "it's been a really challenging time for them".
"But do you apologise?" Newshub asked.
"Absolutely," Keoghan replied.
The report's 20 recommendations include:
- An independent advisory committee to fix the organisation's culture.
- A stand-alone code of conduct.
- A new independent body for all complaints.
"Change is needed urgently, and we will do that," said Keoghan.
Minister of Internal Affairs Jan Tinetti said she has confidence in the board chair.
"The board chair standing there and saying 'This changes from today', I have good confidence in this."
Firefighters like Stanley are hoping they can share her confidence.
"It's not until every woman in every brigade is safe that we're really talking about cultural change."
Change that can't happen soon enough.
